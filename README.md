# Project Submission Repository

This repository contains all code developed during the project.  
For clarity and ease of evaluation, the **final and relevant submission code** is collected in a dedicated folder.

---

## 📁 Submission Folder

👉 **`07-submission-folder/`**

This folder contains:
- The **cleaned and final version** of the code
- Only the files required to **run, reproduce, and evaluate** the results
- A clear structure without experimental or intermediate artifacts

**This is the folder that should be used for grading.**

---

## 📂 Other Files and Folders

The remainder of the repository includes:
- Earlier experiments
- Development scripts
- Intermediate results
- Scratch code and exploration notebooks

These files are kept for completeness and traceability, but **are not part of the final submission**.

## ▶️ How to Use

Please navigate to the submission folder:

```bash
cd 07-submission-folder
